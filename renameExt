# FUNCTION: Change all file extensions from ORIG_EXT to NEW_EXT.
# NOTES:
#   In the conditional below, "1> /dev/null 2>&1" removes the output of the ls check.
#   "1> /dev/null" redirects the standard output (1) to /dev/null, which discards it.
#   "2>&1" redirects standard error (2) to standard output (1), which also discards it
#       (because standard output has already been redirected to /dev/null).
